The first fun in 7-Zip

Opening 7-Zip always works, because you have to open archives...

...but it's called "7-Zip File Manager" for a reason...

The first discovery: Schuladmin

The first file sharing "exploit": 73Wartung

#insert screen here

And now for something completely different: firefox.exe

You have to be able to browse the web.
(most of the time, some teachers block it)
So you have to be able to use Firefox or Chrome.
Sometimes Chrome is blocked, but Firefox has only been blocked once.

But how does blocking work?

...and you got unprivileged ACX. (Arbitrary Code eXecution)

So now we can play DOOM with DOSBox (and get caught)
...and run our own tools ;)
